# Overview
This project shows how visualizations and machine learning demonstrate the 20223 sales prediction at various stores. This also aims to predict future sales based on the given data. 

# Insights 
The linear regression model is the preferred choice compared to the random forest regressor, showing superior performance in terms of various evaluation metrics on both training and testing datasets. It exhibits lower Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and higher R-squared values, indicating its ability to provide more accurate predictions for the target variable in the given dataset.

# Evaluation Metrics
R-squared gauges the fraction of the variability in the dependent variable (target) that can be anticipated based on the independent variables (features). A greater R-squared value signifies a more effective alignment of the model with the dataset.
